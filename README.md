# GDB Guide üêû

## What is GDB? ü§î
GDB stands for **GNU DeBugger**. It assists in debugging the binary object files created during the compilation process. 

When a program crashes, especially during segmentation faults, GDB can be invaluable. It provides a window into the behavior of your program, allowing you to:

- üîç **Step through** a program line by line.
- üìç **Set breakpoints** that halt your program.
- üõë Make your program stop under specific conditions.
- üìä **Display** current variable values.
- üî¨ Examine the contents of any frame on the call stack.

## Languages Supported by GDB üåê
GDB supports a range of languages, including but not limited to:

- Ada
- Assembly
- C
- C++
- D
- Fortran
- Go
- Objective-C
- OpenCL
- Modula-2
- Pascal
- Rust

## Installing GDB üíæ
To install GDB, you can use the package manager on Debian-based systems:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install gdb
$ gdb --version
```
