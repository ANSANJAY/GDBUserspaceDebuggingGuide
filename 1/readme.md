# How to Compile a Program for GDB Debugging 🔍

## Compiling with Debug Symbols 🛠

To compile a program and include debug symbols for use with GDB:

```bash
$ gcc -g -o binaryfile source_code.c
```

The `-g` flag instructs the compiler to store vital debugging info:

- 📌 **Symbol Names**: The names of variables and functions.
- 📌 **Type Information**: Data types for the symbols.
- 📌 **Source Data**: Files and line numbers where the symbols are defined.

💡 **Tip**: Compare the size of the binary when compiled with and without the `-g` flag to see the added weight of debug symbols.

## Starting GDB 🚀

You can initiate GDB with a target binary in two ways:

1. Directly when invoking GDB:
   ```bash
   $ gdb ./binaryfile
   ```

2. By starting GDB and then loading the binary:
   ```bash
   $ gdb
   (gdb) file path_to_binary
   ```

Once inside, GDB provides a command-line interface where you can input various debugging commands:

```
(gdb)
```

## Basic Commands 📜

- **Starting the Debug Session**:
   ```bash
   (gdb) run
   ```

- **Exiting GDB**: 
   ```bash
   (gdb) quit
   ```

   You can also use `Ctrl-d` as an alternative.

- **Quiet Mode**:
   ```bash
   (gdb) quiet
   ```

   The `-q` or `--quiet` option suppresses the GDB version info on startup.

## Seeking Help 🆘

If in doubt or seeking more details on a command:
   ```bash
   (gdb) help [command]
   ```

## Interview Questions on GDB Compilation & Basics 🤓

### Q1: How do you instruct the GCC compiler to include debugging symbols in the compiled binary?
**A**: By using the `-g` flag, as in `gcc -g -o binaryfile source_code.c`.

### Q2: What's the purpose of the `-g` flag during GCC compilation?
**A**: It instructs the compiler to store debug symbols in the executable, including symbol names, type info for symbols, and the files/line numbers where the symbols originated.

### Q3: If you've started GDB without specifying a binary, how can you load one later?
**A**: You can use the command `(gdb) file path_to_binary`.

### Q4: Describe how to start a debug session in GDB.
**A**: Once inside GDB, use the command `(gdb) run`.

### Q5: How can you exit from the GDB session?
**A**: You can use the `(gdb) quit` command or type `Ctrl-d`.

### Q6: What does the `--quiet` or `-q` option do when starting GDB?
**A**: It tells GDB not to print version information upon startup.

### Q7: If uncertain about a GDB command, how can you get more information while within GDB?
**A**: Use the command `(gdb) help [command]` to obtain details or guidance on a specific command.
