**Logging in GDB (GNU Debugger)**
---
1. **Explain the technical concept**
   - **Logging in GDB**: GDB, the GNU Debugger, provides built-in logging facilities that allow developers to save the output of their debugging sessions. This feature is especially useful for recording and analyzing complex scenarios, like intricate stack traces or debugging multi-threaded applications.
     - `set logging on`: Enables the logging mechanism, saving all subsequent output to a file named `gdb.txt` in the current directory.
     - `set logging off`: Disables the logging mechanism. However, multiple log sessions can append to the same log file.
     - `set logging file [filename]`: This command alters the default name of the log file (`gdb.txt`) to the specified `[filename]`.
     
2. **Curious Questions**
   - *Question*: What is the default name of the logfile when logging is enabled in GDB?
     - *Answer*: The default name of the logfile in GDB is `gdb.txt`.
   - *Question*: If I want to change the log file's name while debugging with GDB, which command should I use?
     - *Answer*: You can use the `set logging file [filename]` command to change the name of the logfile.
   - *Question*: Is it possible to turn on and off logging multiple times in a GDB session and still append output to the same logfile?
     - *Answer*: Yes, turning logging on and off multiple times during a GDB session will concatenate the output to the same logfile.

3. **Explain the concept in simple words**
   - üìñ Think of GDB's logging feature as a tape recorder for your debugging adventures. Just like pressing the 'record' button on a recorder, you can tell GDB to "start noting everything down" using `set logging on`. If you want GDB to "stop recording", you use `set logging off`. And if you want to change the name of the tape or file where it's recording, you just tell GDB the new name with `set logging file [newname]`. This feature is super handy when you're going through a complex debugging session and don't want to miss any detail! üéôÔ∏èüìº
