**Using the `command` with breakpoints in gdb**
---

1. **Explain the technical concept**
   - In GDB, users have the ability to attach a sequence of commands to a breakpoint. 
   - When that breakpoint is hit during the program execution, GDB will automatically execute the associated commands.
   - This is particularly useful for automating certain tasks upon hitting a breakpoint, such as printing out variable values, setting other breakpoints, or modifying the state of the program.
   - To attach commands to a breakpoint, the `command` directive followed by the breakpoint number is used. After entering this directive, GDB waits for the user to type the list of commands, one per line. The sequence ends when the user types "end".
  
2. **Curious Questions**
   - *Question*: What does the `command` directive do in GDB when associated with a breakpoint number?
     - *Answer*: The `command` directive allows the user to specify a sequence of commands that GDB should automatically execute whenever the associated breakpoint is hit.
   - *Question*: Can you give a scenario where attaching commands to a breakpoint can be useful?
     - *Answer*: Yes, for instance, if you have a loop iterating over an array and you set a breakpoint inside that loop, you can attach a command to print the current element of the array each time the breakpoint is hit, allowing you to monitor the loop's progress without manually intervening.
   - *Question*: How do you end the sequence of commands you're specifying for a breakpoint in GDB?
     - *Answer*: You end the sequence by typing "end" on a new line.

3. **Explain the concept in simple words**
   - ðŸŽ¯ Imagine setting an alarm on your phone (which is like setting a breakpoint). Now, think about that alarm not only waking you up but also automatically turning on your coffee machine and reading out the day's weather. That's the idea behind attaching commands to breakpoints in GDB. When your program "alarms" (hits the breakpoint), GDB will "automatically" perform the tasks (commands) you've set for it. It's like giving GDB a mini to-do list for when it reaches certain parts of your code! ðŸ“‹âœ…
